## Introduction

In living memory, people paid a lot of attention to their health, especially their physical health. Yet with the development of modern technology in medicine and a more comprehensive medical care system, the general physical health of the majority seems to be in good care. With the guarantee of their basic physical health, people tend to pay more attention to their mental health. This tendency drives the more frequent appearance of depressing topics such as “Depression” and “Suicide”. Yet, in order to make progress and actually change the depressing situation, people should not only focus on these issues, but also concentrate on happier thoughts. Hence, in this research, we focus on happiness, how people feel about their well-being and happiness across countries, and focus on how the feeling of happy changes over years and the association or even casual effects between several variables.  

The relationship between age and happiness is an interesting issue. In our daily life, teens seem to be happier than adults with heavier burden. But we still need more evidence to support this idea.

Also, The debate of whether higher gdp can increase hapiness is never endless. Some say it does, thus we should work hardly on raising gdp. Some say it actually has a quite opposite influence on our hapiness. Which opinion is true according to our data? We choose gdp as one of the potential key variables to find the association. 

Moreover, humans are an extremely prosocial species. Compared to most primates, humans provide more assistance to family, friends, and strangers, even when costly. Some evidence indicate that there is well-being benefits from donating money.

Both related to money, what's the association between these two variable and happiness? To answer this question, we use the following three variables to find the best linear model that describes the association: age, gdp and generosity. Detailed data description is in the data part below.

## Related work

Our project is inspired by [Woeld Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/). This report raises our interest to study happiness and find its influential factors.

## Research questions

Our research focues on a main question:

- How does people's happiness level change in different criterion?

This main question diverges into four minor and more detailed questions. Those questions are consistent through the course of our project.Following are our detailed questions:

- How people's feeling of happiness differ by where they live?
- How does people's feeling of happiness change when people' grow older's age increase?
- How does happiness levels of different areas change over the years?
- Will people's happiness level change as the change of GDP, generosity and age? For those affect happiness level, what is the linear association between them and happiness level.  


## Data

### Data sources

Our data was downloaded as a .xls file from [World Poll](https://analyticscampus.gallup.com/?ref=Auth).  

### Data cleaning

To analyze our data by continent, we need to add the continent variable and remove the data without continent variable. The log_gdp_per_capita was also renamed into gdp for short 

```{r}
## add continents
df = read_xls("data/Chapter2OnlineData.xls") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
df = df %>% 
  mutate(continent = countrycode(sourcevar = country_name,
                                 origin = "country.name",
                                 destination = "continent")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(continent, country_name, everything())%>%
  drop_na(continent) %>% 
  rename(gdp = log_gdp_per_capita)

## read age_group dataset
age_data <- read_excel("./data/GallupAnalytics_Export_20191203_075046.xlsx",
                       range = "B8:G5209") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(country_name = geography,
         year = time,
         age = demographic_value,
         n = n_size,
         ladder = value) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

### Data description

`life_ladder` represent the happiness score or subjective well-being which was measured by the Gallup World Poll(GWP) covering years from 2005 to 2018,

`gdp` represent the log transformation of statistics of GDP per capita in purchasing power parity(PPP) at constant 2011 international dollar prices are from the November 14,2018 update of the World Development Indicators (WDI).

`generosity` is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWPquestion “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.

`age` is devided into 3 age groups: 15-30, 30-49, 50+.


## Exploratory analysis

### Geographica

The geographical distribution of happiness across 165 countries were visualized. We get the GENC 3-letter codes for countries applying the countrycode function, and produced interactive plots. Screenshots of these maps are shown below. To see the fully rendered versions, visit our [website](https://qi-yuchen.github.io/P8105_final_project/Geographica.html). This exploration did not intend to find any associations, at least not in  a rigorous way, but to provide us and our readers a tool to interact with our data and get an direct understanding of the current situation of people's feeling of happiness worldwide. From the distribution [map](https://qi-yuchen.github.io/P8105_final_project/Geo_world.html), we can see mean life ladder over years in Europe and Americas is significantly higher than that in Asia and Africa. Four distribution [bar graphs](https://qi-yuchen.github.io/P8105_final_project/Geo_continent.html) were produced. In each continent, there is obvious diversity with regard to happiness.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/map.png")
knitr::include_graphics("./image/bar.png")
```

The code for rendering these plots are the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## For this part, the mean life ladder and the country code for each country are needed to produce the global map.
# add the mean happiness
df_geo = df %>% 
  select(continent, country = country_name, year, life_ladder) %>% 
  group_by(continent, country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_life_ladder = mean(life_ladder)) %>% 
  ungroup()
df_geo$continent[165] = "Europe"

# add the country code
df_geo = df_geo %>% 
  mutate(code = countrycode(sourcevar = country,
                                 origin = "country.name",
                                 destination = "genc3c"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Global view
# light grey boundaries
l <- list(color = toRGB("grey"), width = 0.5)

# specify map projection/options
g <- list(
  showframe = FALSE,
  showcoastlines = FALSE,
  projection = list(type = 'Mercator')
)

# here is the map
plot_geo(df_geo) %>%
  add_trace(
    z = ~mean_life_ladder, color = ~mean_life_ladder, colors = 'Blues',
    text = ~country, locations = ~code, marker = list(line = l)
  ) %>%
  colorbar(title = 'Expectation of life ladder') %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Global Distribution of Happiness',
    geo = g
  )
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Continent view
# Africa
df_geo %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>% 
  mutate(country = reorder(country, mean_life_ladder)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~country, y = ~mean_life_ladder, color = ~country, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "country name", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "expectation of life ladder", range = c(0,8))
    )

# Americas
df_geo %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% 
  mutate(country = reorder(country, mean_life_ladder)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~country, y = ~mean_life_ladder, color = ~country, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "country name", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "expectation of life ladder", range = c(0,8))
    )

# Asia and Oceania
df_geo %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia" | continent == "Oceania") %>% 
  mutate(country = reorder(country, mean_life_ladder)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~country, y = ~mean_life_ladder, color = ~country, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "country name", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "expectation of life ladder", range = c(0,8))
    )

# Europe
df_geo %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% 
  mutate(country = reorder(country, mean_life_ladder)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~country, y = ~mean_life_ladder, color = ~country, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "country name", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "expectation of life ladder", range = c(0,8))
    )
```


### Age Group

```{r boxplot}
## join datasets
age_df <- age_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = age,
              values_from = c(ladder, n)) %>%
  left_join(df, ., by = c("country_name", "year")) %>%
  select(country_name:life_ladder, "ladder_15-29":"n_DK/Refused") %>%
  pivot_longer("ladder_15-29":"n_DK/Refused", 
               names_to = c("variable", "age"),
               names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = value)

## boxplot
age_df %>%
  filter(age != "DK/Refused") %>%
  drop_na %>%
  mutate(age = as.factor(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ladder, color = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "The Boxplot of Happiness Score",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Happiness Score"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.95, vjust = 0.2)) +
  facet_grid(~year)
```

##### Analysis

By plotting the boxplots throughout the years, we can see that overall there are distinct differences among these age groups. It is relatively obvious that the age group of `15-29` have rank their happiness in higher scores than the other two groups, and the age group of `50+` tend to have the lowest happiness score . It appears that younger people tend to have higher happiness score, ie. the `life_ladder` variable. Therefore, we are going to include `age_group` as one of the factor in our final regression model since the strong association we see in this graph.

### Time
As showing in the geographical distribution of happiness, in addition to the age we mentioned above, we also noticed a variety of happiness among countries and especially among continents which might be related to the gdp and generosity scale. 
In this analysis, we firstly study the hapiness scale with full data from 2010 to 2018 in the whole world
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#average happiness from 2008 to 2010 in each continent
plot_cont_happiness =
  df %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2010:2018)) %>%
  dplyr::select(continent,country_name,year,life_ladder) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = life_ladder
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("X"),
    names_to = "year",
    names_prefix = "x",
    values_to = "life_ladder"
  ) %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(life_ladder = mean(life_ladder)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,y = life_ladder,color = continent)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = continent)) + labs(y = "life ladder")

# average gdp from 2008 to 2010 in each continent
plot_cont_gdp =
  df %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2010:2018)) %>%
  dplyr::select(continent,country_name,year,gdp) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = gdp
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("X"),
    names_to = "year",
    names_prefix = "x",
    values_to = "gdp"
  ) %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(gdp=mean(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,y = gdp,color = continent)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = continent))  

# average generosity from 2008 to 2010 in each continent
plot_cont_gen =
  df %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2010:2018)) %>%
  dplyr::select(continent,country_name,year,generosity) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = generosity
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("X"),
    names_to = "year",
    names_prefix = "x",
    values_to = "generosity"
  ) %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(generosity = mean(generosity)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,y = generosity,color = continent)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = continent))  

plot_cont_happiness + (plot_cont_gdp/plot_cont_gen )
  
```
It is obvious that the in the 9-year period of intersted study, the Oceania has the highest level of happiness that above 7 during the study period, while Africa has the lowest level of happiness ranged from 4 to 4.5 in the study period.Europe and America have similar life ladder within 6 and 6.5, where America was slightly higher in 2010 than Europe while Europe exceeded since 2015. Asia had life ladder slightly less than 5.5 and generally kept in a stable level in the study period. Compared with the gdp scale and the generosity in each continent, we can easily noticed that a similar pattern exist that Oceania tended to have the highest average gdp and generosity while Africa tended to have lowest level.
As for the change of life ladder, gdp and generosity changed through years for any specific country reader might interested in, the link below provided a visulization plot of the time trend for all countries we studied.

## Discussion




Our best linear regression model is a multiple linear regression model with GDP, negerosity and age as variables and happiness level as the outcome. This model indicates that our happiness level will increase as we increase our gdp and generosity. This is our expected result because it gives us motivation to develop economics and be more generosity, both of the which can contribute more positive energy to our society. People could use this result as a guidance and build a more wealthy, economic-friendly and warm society.   

Meanwhile, we can also tell form the model that younger the age, higher the happiness. This is also our expected result because, in real life, it is more likely to see a happy smile on a kid's face compared to an adult's. This indicates that society could pay more attention to mental health of adults and develop more adults' mental health care service. On the other hand, it is also a good way to boost adults' happiness level through education about happiness. If people are losing their sensibility of happiness as they grow up, it means that their ability in sensing happiness is not developed through their educatoin. Therefore, schools and colleges could develop their education about happiness. By doing this, poeple will build a mind set that does well in sensing happiness and hence the situation of decreasing happiness level as age increases will be changed in the good way.
